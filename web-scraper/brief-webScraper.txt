brief-webScraper.txt

I want to create a web scraper. since my startup is empowering events for competition or concert which mean its occur annualy. So if i want to approach new client it has to be the in 1-2 month before the event date (concert or competition day) 

Im targeting event in period of december - may. my first strategy is to find instagram account that promote my client-type events. Before creating this project, i had to scroll,  write the contact and chat all of it manually.

with the current crm, i hope that it automatically list the instagram post of the event so i can just click and look at the poster, if there is a phone number in the caption the crm table is auto-filled the number. But filtered out if in the caption written “free registration/free entry” so everything will be much faster


for now, i breakdown step by step task for claude
1 try to scroll in certain instagram page example https://www.instagram.com/infolomba.sch
2 copy all the post link that posted around december 2024 to april 2025
3 list the title of event and instagram link in table colomn, add another colomn of formalized phone number (if it existed in caption)
