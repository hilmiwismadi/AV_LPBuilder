Perfect! I've fixed the error and created a credential file system for     
  you. Here's what changed:

  ✅ Fixed Issues

  1. Fixed the waitForTimeout error - Replaced with proper delay function    
  2. Created config.json - Now you can store your Instagram credentials      
  3. Automatic login - No more manual login, it reads from config file       
  4. Better error handling - Clear messages if something goes wrong

  🚀 Quick Setup (3 Steps)

  Step 1: Edit config.json

  Open the file at: web-scraper/config.json

  Replace with YOUR credentials:

  {
    "instagram": {
      "username": "your_actual_instagram_username",
      "password": "your_actual_instagram_password"
    },
    "scraping": {
      "targetAccounts": ["infolomba.sch"],
      "startDate": "2024-12-01",
      "endDate": "2025-05-31",
      "maxScrolls": 30
    }
  }

  Step 2: Run the Scraper

  cd web-scraper
  npm start

  Step 3: View Results

  npm run view

  🎯 How It Works Now

  1. Browser opens automatically
  2. Reads your credentials from config.json
  3. Logs in automatically - no manual input needed!
  4. Saves session - next time, no login required
  5. Starts scraping - collects posts, extracts phone numbers, filters       
  free events
  6. Saves to database - events.db

  🔒 Security

  - config.json is ignored by git (won't be committed)
  - Your credentials stay local only
  - Session saved in instagram-cookies.json (also ignored by git)
  - One-time login - session persists across runs
